# Images classification
## Introduction
- Using python to Engage in a research project on images classification through TensorFlow framework.
- A convolutional neural network with two convolutional layers, two pooled layers, and two fully connected layers was designed to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset and obtains 85% accuracy.
- Analyzed the influence on accuracy based on different batch sizes, pooling methods and activation functions
